# FlourPackProblem

2 different sacks with flour

bigCount = 5kg
smallCount = 1kg 

The sum of the two packs should be atleast equal to the goal(kg)
but the pack of 5 cannot be divided 
therefore if we have 2 packs of 5kg and the goal is 9kg the program should return false; because the two packs of flour cannot be divided 
thouhg if we have 1 pack of 5kg and 5packs of 1kg the program should return true, because we have reached the mininum goal and we have remainder or 1kg
